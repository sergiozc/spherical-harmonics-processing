# Spherical Harmonic Processing
This repository contains code related to spherical harmonics in the context of speech enhancement and acoustics:
- Useful functions of spherical harmonics (calculation & visualization).
- Several room-acoustic tests using spherical arrays of microphones
- Characterization of acoustic field diffusivity using spherical harmonics.
- A spectral power density estimation method based on spherical harmonics for separating audio sources is implemented (not entirely correct).
- A beamformer in the spherical harmonic domain is implemented.
- Comparison between two beamformers (one of them based on spherical harmonics).
## Simulation
This folder contains acoustics tests using spherical microphone arrays and spherical harmonics performance checks.
## Experiment
Real tests using a high order microphone have been performed. The performance of a beamformer based on spherical harmonics is tested.
